# Standard LED Strips

- 300 LED per 5 meter (16.4 ft)
  + 5V or 12V
  + 40W worst case for WS2811 and WS2815 12V LED strips
  + typical for 5V (WS2812B, WS2812B Eco, WS2813, SK9822, SK6812) 20W

Note that many LED strips only have 150 LEDs per 5 meters.

Plan on design working for 400W or 10 strips of 12V and 20 strips of 5V.
